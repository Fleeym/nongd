# NONGD

> **NOTE**: This mod is still in very early development, I'm still figuring out Geode so this will take a while. The README here is a proof of concept, basically what I want to achieve with this mod.

NONGD is a song manager for Geometry Dash. It swapps newgrounds songs with their NONG counterparts.

## What is NONG?

NONG stands for **Not On NewGrounds**. Basically, it means any song that is not on Newgrounds that was replaced manually through the game files. 

NONGs have always been a hassle to manage, because some level creators use popular Newgrounds song IDs and replace them with a NONG. So you have to swap those song files around quite a bit if you play a level with the newgrounds song and a level with a NONG song.

## Enter NONGD

NONGD stands for **Not On NewGrounds, Duh**. It automates the process of swapping NONGs with their Newgrounds counterparts. It even allows for multiple NONGs on the same song ID.

## How does it work? (how it will work, actually)

NONGD uses YT-DLP under the hood to download songs from YouTube. An alternative is downloading the NONG file yourself.

After getting the mp3 file, you need to fill out the song name and author name. This is mostly for remembering which song is which, since they will all have the same name.
